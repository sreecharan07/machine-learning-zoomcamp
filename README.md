# 🚀 Machine Learning Zoomcamp Journey

Welcome to my repository for the **Machine Learning**!  
This repo tracks my learning, assignments, and projects as I build strong foundations in **Machine Learning**.  

---
## 📘 Module 1: Introduction
- Introduction to ML concepts and workflow  
- Rule-Based Systems vs Machine Learning  
- Supervised Learning (regression, classification, ranking)  
- CRISP-DM methodology for structuring ML projects  
- Train/Validation/Test splits and why they matter  

### 🛠️ Assignment
Worked with the **Car Fuel Efficiency dataset**:
- Environment setup with Anaconda  
- Data exploration & cleaning using Pandas  
- Handling missing values  
- Analyzing distributions  
- Matrix operations with NumPy (implemented linear regression from scratch!)  

### 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Machine Learning starts with **business questions**, not just models.  
- Rule-based systems have limits; ML adds adaptability.  
- Data preparation & validation are just as important as training.  
- Start simple — a baseline model often provides immediate value.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter/Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn (from Module 2 onwards)
